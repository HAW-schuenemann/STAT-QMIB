## 1. Overview

Beginners often encounter similar error messages when working with R.  
This guide explains the most common issues, what the error messages mean, and how to fix them.

If you receive an error in R, do not panic - R error messages are often very literal and give hints about what went wrong.

---

## 2. “Error: object not found”

### What it means  
R cannot find the variable or object you are trying to use.

### Common causes  
- Typo in the variable name  
- The object has not been created yet  
- You forgot to run the line where the object is defined  
- Wrong working directory when loading data  
- Using the wrong data frame name  

### Example

```r
freq(df$agee)
```

Error:

```
Error: object 'agee' not found
```

### How to fix  
- Check for spelling mistakes  
- Make sure you ran the code that creates the object  
- Confirm you typed the data frame name correctly  
- Run `names(df)` to see the correct variable names  

---

## 3. “could not find function …”

### What it means  
R does not know the function you are trying to use.

### Common causes  
- You forgot to load the package with `library()`  
- You misspelled the function name  

### Example

```r
freq(df$age)
```

Error:

```
could not find function "freq"
```

### How to fix  
Make sure the required package is loaded:

```r
library(summarytools)
```

Install the package if needed:

```r
install.packages("summarytools")
```

---

## 4. “unexpected symbol” or “unexpected input”

### What it means  
R stopped reading your code because something is written in a way R does not understand.

### Common causes  
- Missing comma or parenthesis  
- A stray character such as `@`, `:` or German umlaut in the wrong place  
- A space in the object name  

### Example

```r
new var <- 10
```

Error:

```
unexpected symbol in "new var"
```

### How to fix  
- Remove spaces in object names (`new_var`)  
- Check parentheses and commas  
- Re-type the line carefully  

---

## 5. “cannot open the connection”

### What it means  
R cannot find or open a file you are trying to load.

### Common causes  
- Wrong working directory  
- Misspelled filename  
- The file is not in the folder you expect  
- Missing file extension  

### Example

```r
df <- readRDS("data.rds")
```

Error:

```
Error in readRDS("data.rds") : cannot open the connection
```

### How to fix  
- Check the working directory:

```r
getwd()
```

- Use the Files pane to navigate to the file  
- Confirm the file name and extension  
- Set the working directory correctly:

```r
setwd("path/to/your/folder")
```

---

## 6. “subscript out of bounds”

### What it means  
You tried to access a column or row that does not exist.

### Common causes  
- Wrong column name  
- Using `df[ , 5]` when the data frame has fewer than 5 columns  
- Filtering resulted in an empty dataset  

### How to fix  
- Check available columns with:

```r
names(df)
```

- Check dataset structure with:

```r
str(df)
```

---

## 7. “NA/NaN argument” or “missing values”

### What it means  
A function encountered missing values (`NA`).

### Example

```r
mean(df$age)
```

Error:

```
missing values and NaN’s not allowed
```

### How to fix  
Allow NA removal:

```r
mean(df$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

## 8. “object of type 'closure' is not subsettable”

### What it means  
You accidentally used parentheses instead of `$` or `[]` when trying to access a variable.

### Example

```r
df(age)
```

### How to fix  
Use the correct syntax:

```r
df$age
```

or:

```r
df[["age"]]
```

---

## 9. “could not find function ‘%>%’”

### What it means  
You are using a pipe but did not load `dplyr`.

### Fix  

```r
library(dplyr)
```

---

## 10. “non-numeric argument to binary operator”

### What it means  
You tried to perform a mathematical operation on something that is not numeric.

### Example

```r
df$gender + 10
```

### How to fix  
Check the variable type:

```r
class(df$gender)
```

Convert if necessary (only when meaningful):

```r
as.numeric(df$variable)
```

## 11. Summary of Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|--------|------|
| Object not found | Check spelling, run previous lines |
| Function not found | Load package with `library()` |
| Unexpected symbol | Check punctuation and spaces |
| Cannot open connection | Set working directory correctly |
| Pipe `%>%` not found | Load `dplyr` |
| Non-numeric argument | Check variable type |
| NA problems | Use `na.rm = TRUE` |

## 12. Final Advice

- Read error messages slowly; they are usually very informative.  
- Run your script from top to bottom when debugging.  
- Always check the working directory, loaded packages, and variable names.  
- Use `str(df)` to understand what you are working with.  
- Errors are a normal part of coding — they do not mean you did something fundamentally wrong.

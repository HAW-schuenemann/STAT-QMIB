## 1. R and RStudio (Official Sources)

### R (Programming Language)
- Official website for downloading R
- Always provides the latest stable version

https://cran.r-project.org/

### RStudio (IDE used in this course)
- Integrated development environment for R
- Recommended for all course exercises

https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Note: R must be installed before RStudio.

---

## 2. RStudio Cheat Sheets (Highly Recommended)

RStudio provides official cheat sheets that summarise important functions
and workflows on one or two pages.

### Overview of all cheat sheets
https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/

### Most relevant for this course

#### Data Transformation (dplyr)
https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html

https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf

Useful for:
- select()
- filter()
- mutate()
- summarise()
- group_by()

#### Data Visualisation (ggplot2)
https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html

https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf

Useful for:
- ggplot()
- geom_bar()
- geom_boxplot()
- geom_point()

#### Data Import
https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-import.html

https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-import.pdf

Useful for:
- read.csv()
- readRDS()
- working with different file formats

## 3. R Help and Documentation

### Built-in R help (inside RStudio)
Use `?` followed by the function name:

```r
?mean
?quantile
?freq
```

This opens the official documentation directly in RStudio.

### Online documentation
https://rdocumentation.org/

Helpful if you want to search for functions without opening RStudio.

## 4. R for Data Science (Online Book)

R for Data Science  
by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

Relevant chapters for this course:
- Data transformation
- Data visualisation
- Exploratory data analysis

Note:
The book uses tidyverse-style workflows.
In this course, packages are loaded explicitly (e.g. dplyr, ggplot2),
but the concepts still apply.

---

## 5. Community Support and Error Messages

### Stack Overflow (R questions)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r

Helpful when encountering error messages.

Recommended search strategy:
- Copy the error message
- Add the function name
- Add "R"

Important:
Do not copy solutions blindly.
Use them to understand the problem and adapt the solution
to the methods used in this course.

## 6. How to Use External Resources Effectively

External resources are meant to support learning, not replace it.

Recommended approach:
1. Try to solve the task on your own first.
2. Compare your solution with the course repository.
3. Use external resources only if something is unclear.
4. Rewrite the solution in your own words and code.

Active practice is essential.
Reading code alone is not sufficient to learn R.

---

## 7. Reminder for Exam Preparation

- Practise writing code yourself
- Do not memorise solutions line by line
- Focus on understanding:
  - which function to use
  - why it is used
  - how to interpret the output

The repository and these resources are tools to support you,
but they do not replace independent practice.
